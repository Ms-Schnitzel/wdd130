      <p>My name is Zac, and I am a budding software developer.  I am currently studying while working with Granite Credit Union.  I spend most of my free time gaming and reading when I'm not spending time with my wife and husky puppy.  I have dabbled in some web development bootcamps, but I am eager to focus my studies and really double down on advancing my knowledge and experience with web and software development!</p>
